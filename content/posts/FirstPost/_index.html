 <h1>Ghost Blog Created</h1>
Finished creating, updating and theming <a href="https://blog.opekktar.online/" target="_blank">Opekktar Online Blog</a>. Repurposed an old jail that was running another ghost blog for a different domain. Sure it might have been a little messy but it was a great learning experience and challenge. OK it was not a challenge only took a couple of minutes. But I learned a couple of things; I suppose. This domain and blog is completely personal where <a href="https://opekkt.tech/" target="_blank">Opekkt Tech</a> is not so much.
